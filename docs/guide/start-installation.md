Installation
============

## Requirements

The minimum requirement by this application template is that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.

## Installing using Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), follow the instructions in the
[Installing Yii](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/docs/guide/start-installation.md#installing-via-composer) section of the definitive guide to install it.

With Composer installed, you can then install the application using the following commands:

    composer global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:1.0.0"
    composer create-project --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced yii-application

The first command installs the [composer asset plugin](https://github.com/francoispluchino/composer-asset-plugin/)
which allows managing bower and npm package dependencies through Composer. You only need to run this command
once for all. The second command installs the advanced application in a directory named `yii-application`.
You can choose a different directory name if you want.

## Install from an Archive File

Extract the archive file downloaded from [yiiframework.com](http://www.yiiframework.com/download/) to
a directory named `advanced` that is directly under the Web root.

Then follow the instructions given in the next subsection.


## Preparing application

After you install the application, you have to conduct the following steps to initialize
the installed application. You only need to do these once for all.

1. Execute the `init` command and select `dev` as environment.

    ```
    php /path/to/yii-application/init
    ```

    Otherwise, in production execute `init` in non-interactive mode.

    ```
    php /path/to/yii-application/init --env=Production --overwrite=All
    ```

2. Create a new database and adjust the `components['db']` configuration in `common/config/main-local.php` accordingly.
3. Apply migrations with console command `yii migrate`.
4. Set document roots of your web server:

- for frontend `/path/to/yii-application/frontend/web/` and using the URL `http://frontend/`
- for backend `/path/to/yii-application/backend/web/` and using the URL `http://backend/`

To login into the application, you need to first sign up, with any of your email address, username and password.
Then, you can login into the application with same email address and password at any time.
